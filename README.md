#PaLI-GEMMA Model Reproduction
A reproduction of Google's PaLI-GEMMA VLLm model, mainly for learning purposes. This project references the official code and includes detailed notes on tensor shape transformations within the network for better understanding.

Key Points
Focus: Understanding the model structure, with detailed tensor shapes documented at each layer.
Goal: To offer a clear, readable version of PaLI-GEMMA for self-learning.
